Objectives:
•	Provide real-time weather data: Display accurate and up-to-date weather information (current temperature, weather conditions, etc.).
•	User-friendly interface: Develop an easy-to-use interface that displays weather details in a clean and intuitive format.
•	Multiple cities support: Allow users to search and view weather details for different cities around the world.

Key Activities:
•	Requirement gathering and planning: Define the features, user interface, and data flow for the app.
•	Design UI/UX: Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface 
•	API integration: Integrate a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack) to fetch real-time weather data.
•	Location services: Implement location services to fetch weather data based on the user's current location.
•	User input handling: Enable users to search for weather by entering city names or using the device's location.
•	Data parsing and display: Parse the weather data received from the API and display it in a readable and organized format.
•	Testing: Perform functional, usability, and performance testing on the app.

Technology Used:
•	Programming Language:
o	Java or Kotlin (Kotlin is preferred for modern Android development).
•	Android SDK:
o	Android Studio as the primary IDE for development.
•	API:
o	OpenWeatherMap, WeatherStack, or any other weather data API for real-time weather information.
•	User Interface:
o	XML for layouts (UI components like buttons, text fields, etc.).
o	Material Design for a modern, intuitive, and consistent UI.
•	Location Services:
o	Google Play Services Location API or Fused Location Provider for real-time location fetching.
•	Data Parsing:
o	Gson or Moshi for parsing JSON data from the weather API.
•	Version Control:
o	Git (with GitHub or Bitbucket) for version control and collaboration.


Working of Weather App (Android)

The working of a weather app typically involves several key components that interact to provide real-time weather data to users. Here's how the app generally works step-by-step:
1. User Interface (UI):
•	The app opens to a home screen that displays a simple UI showing weather data such as:
o	Current temperature
o	Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)
o	Humidity, wind speed, and pressure
o	Daily/weekly forecast
•	The user can either:
o	Allow location access for automatic weather data based on their current location.
o	Manually input a city name to get weather details for a different location.

2. Fetching Weather Data:
•	The app sends a request to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API or WeatherStack API) with either:
o	The user's coordinates (latitude and longitude) for location-based weather data.
o	A city name if the user manually inputs a location.
•	The API responds with the weather data in JSON format (containing information like temperature, weather condition, humidity, etc.).

3. Data Parsing:
•	The app parses the JSON response using a JSON parsing library like Gson or Moshi.
•	It extracts the relevant weather information (e.g., temperature, weather description, wind speed) and prepares it for display.

4. Displaying Weather Information:
•	The app displays the fetched weather information on the user interface in an easy-to-read format:
o	The temperature is displayed, usually in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
o	Additional data like humidity, wind speed, and pressure are shown as text.
